# My-Responsive-Grid-Website

1. There is an issue with the general grid layout, the columns and rows aren't correctly layed out.
2. There is also an issue with the images I think, getting each one to cover the background in each container.
3. I made the row below the hinterland 2 columns a flex container to position stuff easier in one dimension but that doesn't seem to have worked.
4. In terms of using either media queries or minmax to make the containers responsive to different screen sizes, which is the best way to do this.
