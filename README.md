# My-Responsive-Grid-Website

There is an issue in regard to the grid layout, when you shrink the page down the columns and rows aren't full responsive. 
There is also an issue with the images I think, getting each one to cover the background in each container.
I made the row below the hinterland 2 columns a flex container to position stuff easier in one dimension but that doesn't seem to have worked.
In terms of using either media queries or minmax to make the containers responsive to different screen sizes, which is the best way to do this.
